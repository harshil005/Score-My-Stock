Summary of Implementation:
Project Setup: A Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router is initialized. axios is installed.
Components:
src/components/SearchBar.tsx: Handles user input, fetches autocomplete suggestions from /api/search, and calls onStockSelect when a stock is chosen and submitted.
src/components/StockScoreCard.tsx: Displays loading/error states and the fetched score data (company name, overall score). Includes placeholders for more detailed scores.
API Backend:
src/lib/finnhub.ts: Contains utility functions to interact with the Finnhub API (search, profile, basic financials), using an API key (currently a placeholder).
src/app/api/search/route.ts: Provides autocomplete suggestions by calling searchSymbols.
src/app/api/score/route.ts: Fetches company profile and basic financial data using getCompanyProfile and getBasicFinancials, calculates a placeholder score, and returns the results.
Main Page:
src/app/page.tsx: Integrates the search bar and score card, manages state, and triggers the /api/score fetch when a stock is selected.
Next Steps & Important Notes:
Finnhub API Key: You must add your Finnhub API key. Create a file named .env.local in the project root and add the following line, replacing YOUR_KEY with your actual key:
Apply
Restart the development server (npm run dev) after creating/modifying this file. Without a valid key, the API calls to Finnhub will fail.
Scoring Logic: The core scoring logic in src/app/api/score/route.ts (within the calculateScore function) is currently a placeholder. You need to replace it with your specific algorithm based on the KPIs available from the Finnhub basic financials endpoint and the desired weighting/rules outlined in your README.md or other specifications. You'll also need to update the response to include detailed scores (valuation, profitability, etc.) if you want them displayed on the card.
Run the App: You can start the development server using npm run dev and view the site at http://localhost:3000.
Styling/UI: The current styling provides a clean, basic layout. You can further refine the UI using Tailwind CSS classes in the components and page file.
